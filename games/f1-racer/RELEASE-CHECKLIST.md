# F1 Racer — Release Checklist

## Purpose

Manual regression checklist for the static browser release of F1 Racer. The project has no CI/browser automation configured, so these checks are the release gate until a browser test harness is introduced.

## Static/source checks

- [x] `games/f1-racer/main.js` loads Three.js from the configured CDN.
- [x] `race.html` references `main.js` and `style.css`.
- [x] HUD element IDs referenced by `main.js` exist in `race.html`.
- [x] Current physics state fields are initialized and reset on grid placement.
- [x] AI state fields are initialized and reset on grid placement.
- [x] Race systems (tyres, ERS, pit state) are represented in the wiki.
- [x] No backend/server dependency was introduced.

## Browser smoke test — desktop

Run one complete pass on a current Chromium/Firefox/Safari browser.

1. [ ] Open the F1 Racer menu.
2. [ ] Select each difficulty once.
3. [ ] Open each available circuit.
4. [ ] Confirm the page renders without a blank canvas.
5. [ ] Confirm the qualifying countdown starts and the qualifying session is 60 seconds.
6. [ ] Drive at least one complete qualifying lap.
7. [ ] Confirm a qualifying time is recorded.
8. [ ] Let qualifying finish and confirm a 10-car grid is produced.
9. [ ] Confirm the race countdown freezes all cars until GO.
10. [ ] Confirm grid-position digits face toward the start/finish direction.
11. [ ] Drive one clean lap and verify position/lap/time HUD.
12. [ ] Confirm gear/speed instrument panel is centered at the top and does not overlap left/right HUD.
12. [ ] Verify steering works at low and high speed.
13. [ ] Verify lateral/slip telemetry changes in corners.
14. [ ] Verify gear/shift lights and engine audio respond to speed.
15. [ ] Verify DRS can activate when eligible.
16. [ ] Verify ERS toggles with `E` and charge drains/recharges.
17. [ ] Verify tyre selection with `1`/`2`/`3` before the race.
18. [ ] Verify tyre grip changes with distance.
19. [ ] Verify pit service can be triggered with `P` at low speed in the pit zone.
20. [ ] Verify pit service resets tyre wear, restores ERS and reduces damage.
21. [ ] Verify AI cars follow corners, brake before turns and can change line around traffic.
22. [ ] Verify hard impacts produce damage, sparks and player camera shake.
23. [ ] Verify wet circuits show rain and reduced grip.
24. [ ] Finish the race and verify classification and points.
25. [ ] Continue to the next circuit.
26. [ ] Complete the championship and verify final standings.
27. [ ] Reload and confirm championship persistence.
28. [ ] Reload a circuit and confirm the best-lap ghost still works.

## Browser smoke test — mobile/touch

1. [ ] Open the race on a touch device.
2. [ ] Confirm gas/brake controls are visible.
3. [ ] Confirm the steering wheel is draggable and analog.
4. [ ] Repeated tap, double-tap and pinch on the race canvas must not zoom or move the browser viewport.
5. [ ] Confirm steering drag and simultaneous gas/brake touches do not trigger browser zoom/gesture handling.
6. [ ] Rotate to landscape and accelerate to high speed: the chase camera must keep the player car prominently readable and must not progressively shrink it.
7. [ ] Confirm HUD remains readable without covering the controls.
8. [ ] Confirm race rendering remains responsive.
9. [ ] Confirm cockpit/chase camera toggle still works where a keyboard is available.
10. [ ] Confirm results overlay is usable on a short viewport.

## Release criteria

A release is considered ready when:
- no blank/uncaught runtime error appears during the smoke test;
- qualifying → grid → race → result flow completes;
- championship persistence works;
- desktop and touch controls both remain usable;
- the new physics/race systems do not prevent completing a clean race.

## Known test limitation

This repository currently has no automated browser/physics test runner and no GitHub Actions release gate. Source-level assertions can catch wiring regressions, but they cannot replace a real browser smoke test for rendering, controls, audio and gameplay feel.


## Runoff / audio / home regression

- [ ] Drive across a kerb and beyond the asphalt: the car must slow progressively but remain movable; no invisible hard stop at the old track-width wall limit.
- [ ] Verify engine note rises through each gear, drops on shifts, and remains free of obvious clipping/distortion on desktop and mobile.
- [ ] Verify the F1 Racer home shows the new hero, difficulty, standings and circuit sections, and that difficulty/circuit/championship interactions still work.


## Garage regression

- [ ] Home Garage entry opens `garage.html` and Back returns to F1 Racer.
- [ ] Car is visible and rotates 360° with pointer/touch drag.
- [ ] Every component variant can be mounted by drag-and-drop on desktop and click/tap fallback on touch devices.
- [ ] Selected setup survives page reload via localStorage.
- [ ] Live Speed/Downforce/Braking/Stability/Traction bars react to setup changes.
- [ ] Front/rear wing variants visibly change wing geometry in the Garage.
- [ ] Start a race after changing setup and verify top speed, braking, turn authority/stability, traction and runoff behaviour respond to the relevant choices.
- [ ] Balanced setup remains close to the pre-Garage baseline and no variant is a universal upgrade.


## Driving dynamics regression

- [ ] Compare braking in a straight line vs braking while steering: combined braking/cornering must require more distance and feel less planted.
- [ ] Enter a corner under braking: turn-in should sharpen while excessive combined demand can loosen stability progressively, not snap instantly.
- [ ] Accelerate before unwinding steering: traction/acceleration should be weaker than on a straight exit.
- [ ] Release steering after a slide: lateral motion should recover progressively rather than snap to zero.
- [ ] Verify keyboard and touch steering remain controllable at low and high speed.
- [ ] Verify Garage setup effects still alter the evolved physics after a reload.


## Camera / finish / collision / Garage coherence

- [ ] Chase view: player car is substantially larger/closer on desktop and compact landscape without clipping the camera.
- [ ] Complete fewer than the configured race laps: results overlay must never appear.
- [ ] A lap only increments after reaching mid-circuit and crossing start/finish forward.
- [ ] Complete exactly all configured laps: results appear once after the final valid crossing.
- [ ] Side-by-side rubbing does not repeatedly remove a fixed percentage of both cars' speed.
- [ ] Nose-to-tail contact separates cars and transfers speed progressively without repeated bouncing.
- [ ] Garage car silhouette/details match the race car model closely.
- [ ] Drag each of the five component families: only its matching mounting zone highlights and accepts the drop.
- [ ] Touch/click mounting still works without drag-and-drop.

## Atelier visual upgrade regression

- [ ] Inspect the sculpted car, studio reflections, contact shadows and platform on desktop and a real mobile GPU.
- [ ] Check all four camera presets at desktop, portrait mobile and landscape sizes.
- [ ] Orbit with mouse/touch; release, pointer cancellation and a second touch must not leave dragging stuck.
- [ ] Toggle 360°; reduced-motion users must not get automatic movement.
- [ ] Preview all three paint finishes; only body paint changes and race livery stays unchanged.
- [ ] Select all 15 setup variants; reload to verify persistence and stat bars.
- [ ] Drag each component family to its matching target; reject a different target.
- [ ] Verify keyboard focus and pressed state on view, paint and setup buttons.
- [ ] Load a dry and wet race with the shared model; check wheels, opponents and ghost transparency.
- [ ] Measure frame time on an actual phone with all ten cars visible. Software rendering is not a mobile performance benchmark.

### Validation record — Atelier branch

- PASS: Node syntax parsing for every F1 Racer JS module; `git diff --check`.
- PASS: imported `car-model.js` against actual Three.js r160 in Node; both detail
  levels construct successfully with finite vertex positions/normals, four wheel
  groups, scaled wheel radius and named wing assemblies. Canvas is stubbed only
  for the carbon texture: this does not validate texture rendering.
- PASS: material isolation between separate cars (ghost opacity cannot mutate
  another car). Geometry counts: race 29 meshes / 10,792 triangles; showroom 203
  meshes / 23,456 triangles. These counts are not measured frame rates.
- PASS (follow-up): Chromium headless 151 installed from the alternative Chrome
  for Testing distribution. Actual WebGL rendering via SwiftShader, no page or
  console errors observed in the exercised flow. Three.js CDN requests were
  fulfilled with the downloaded exact r160 module to isolate CDN networking.
- PASS: desktop garage rendering, all 15 component variants and localStorage
  values, reload selection, camera presets, paint and rotation button states,
  mouse orbit, matching/mismatching synthetic native drop events.
- PASS: mobile emulation at 390x844, no horizontal overflow, tap view/setup
  selection and landscape rendering at 844x390. Visual inspection exposed a
  clipped front wing in portrait; camera distance was increased accordingly.
- PASS: race initialization, rendered canvas/countdown and short keyboard input /
  camera-switch smoke without observed runtime errors. This is not a full race.
- NOT TESTED: real-device multitouch/cancel gestures, full qualifying-to-result
  and championship regression, wet-race regression, hardware GPU/mobile FPS.
  Software-rendered headless screenshots cannot certify actual device performance.
