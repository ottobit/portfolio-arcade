# F1 Racer Overview

F1 Racer is the active flagship game in `portfolio-arcade`. It is a static
browser game built with plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Three.js.

## Current Shape

- The race page has been split out of the original monolithic `main.js` into
  focused modules for input, HUD, camera, AI, player physics, race systems,
  race progress, car view and race commands.
- The procedural car is shared between race and garage through
  `games/f1-racer/car-model.js`.
- The garage persists setup choices through `games/f1-racer/garage-setup.js`.
- Driver names are stored in `championship.js`; player display selection is
  handled by `driver-selection.js`.
- The user prefers the top HUD panel as-is and wants manual gameplay validation
  instead of automated browser smoke tests by default.

## Current User Priorities

- Keep improving the visual spectacle of the race and garage.
- Make controls comfortable on touch devices with large thumbs.
- Make the garage show meaningful visual effects while choosing parts.
- Add cockpit themes for the named friends/drivers.
- Make garage color selection affect the real race car and expose all five
  team color pairs.
